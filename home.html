      <h2>Website with Bad Design</h2>
      <h3>Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</h3>
      Page: Supplies > Labels<br>
      Link: <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/Supplies/Labels/">www2.pnwx.com/Supplies/Labels/</a><br><br>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <h3>Usability</h3>
      <li>Search input text and the “Go” button are almost invisible. They are a part of the title header area, and this
        is very counter-intuitive.</li>
      <li>The different category buttons (Home, Equipment, Accessories, Supplies, Parts) appear as if they are a
        part of the title header area as well. They are hidden, and it is almost impossible for users to tell that the
        small, floating words are actually buttons.</li>
      <li>The product description is very disorganized and not informative. The different pieces of information are
        not grouped together conveniently for each product.</li>
      <li>It is almost impossible for users to figure out how to actually place orders.</li>
      <li>The instructions to making orders is very difficult to find. There is a link at the bottom of the page,
        which leads users to a separate instructions page when clicked. The website is conveying information very
        inconveniently, and users need to navigate through multiple pages to make one order.</li>
      <li>There is no “Add to Cart” feature. Therefore, users need to remember the products and stock numbers to
        place their orders.</li>
      <li>The text is hard and uncomfortable to read because of the low contrast between the text color and the
        background, and the background as well as the logo on the title header area can be hurting users’ eyes.</li>
      <li>The sizes and spacing between pictures, tables, and texts are very inconsistent. They are all over the
        place, and many visual features do not align with each other.</li>
      <li>The website is very static and hardly has any responsive or interactive features. This makes the website
        very hard to use and buttons hard to tell apart from simple text.</li>

      <h3>Learnability</h3>
      <li>Hard, Impossible for users to figure out how to actually make orders at first. The instructions are hard to
        learn </li>
      <li>Information is very spread out. Thus, users need to actually proactively look for the order methods and
        other necessary information.
      </li>
      <li>Very disorganized and counter-intuitive, making the website and its features hard to learn and keeping the
        users from wanting to learn about the website.</li>
      <li>The icons, pictures, descriptions, product information, and purchasing process are not intuitive at all.
      </li>
      <li>Users need to take a long time to study how the website is structured, how to make orders, and what
        different components of the website even represent.</li>

      <h3>Memorability</h3>
      <li>Not memorable at all. </li>
      <li>Difficulty remembering how to navigate through the website and get to the desired pages and make payments.
      </li>
      <li>Some components are so abnormal, disorganized, and counter-intuitive that they are easy to forget and need
        significant effort and time to remember/discover again.</li>
      <br><br>

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      For the webpage chosen, WebAIM WAVE reports 19 errors, 13 contrast errors, 33 alerts, 2 features, 0 structural
      elements, and 0 ARIA. The 19 errors are mostly “Missing alternative text” errors, and others include “Linked image
      missing alternative text,” “Image map area missing alternative text,” “Missing form label,” “Language missing or
      invalid,” and “Empty link” errors. The 13 contrast errors all indicate “very low contrast.” The 33 alerts are
      mostly “Layout table,” and others include “No heading structure,” “No page regions,” “Suspicious link text,”
      “Redundant link,” “Link to PDF document,” “Very small text,” and “Underlined text.” <br><br> Overall, the multiple
      Contrast Errors are especially problematic and concerning because they are prevalent throughout the entire
      webpage. The black, bright yellow, or neon text colors do not harmonize at all with the various gradational shades
      of blue, ranging from sky blue to deep blue, making the text very hard to read and website very inaccessible.
      Also, the layout table (which is only visually tabular, and content is not tabular at all in nature) errors are
      prevalent and need to be fixed as well.

      <br><br><br>
      <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
      <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
      I used Balsamiq to produce the following wireframes.<br><br>
      <h4>Mobile</h4>
      <img src="./lofi-mobile.png" width="1000"></img><br><br>
      <h4>Tablet</h4>
      <img src="./lofi-tablet.png" width="1000"></img><br><br>
      <h4>Desktop</h4>
      <img src="./lofi-desktop.png" width="1000"></img><br><br>
      The wireframes show the organized components of the website. Instead of spreading out texts and tables all over
      the website without any alignment, I have added consistency to the format, making it significantly more organized.
      Also, this design solves the difficulty of finding the separate instructions to placing orders and makes it easy
      to add products to the cart (after choosing the color and the quantity) and adding to the cart. This enables users
      to avoid having to memorize the stock number and inconveniently making orders. Also, I have organized the
      description for each product together in one place, so that it is easy to compare and immediately grasp. I have
      also solved another design problem original website: the inconspicuousness of the category buttons and the search
      input/button. Thus, I have placed them in the middle to allow users to navigate through the website easily without
      being lost.

      <br><br><br>
      <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
      <h4>Mobile</h4>
      <img src="./hifi-mobile.png" width="500"></img><br><br>
      <h4>Tablet</h4>
      <img src="./hifi-tablet.png" width="700"></img><br><br>
      <h4>Desktop</h4>
      <img src="./hifi-desktop.png" width="1200"></img><br><br>
      The prototypes show the choice of colors that harmonize well, and the clear contrast between the text and the
      background color, making the text more visible and easier to read. I made the background as plain white to make
      the product description easy to read and place all focus on the products themselves (and not on the background).
      Also, I made the product images and
      descriptions align with each other and consistent in size and format.
      <br><br><br>
      <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
      <img src="./Style Guide.png" width="1000"></img><br><br>
      There are various interactive/responsive components in this newly created webpage. When hovering over clickable
      elements, the cursor always becomes a pointer. When hovering over buttons such as "View Cart," "Add to Cart," and
      "Search," the buttons have a darker border and a shadow. If the cursor hovers over an image, it gains a darker
      border and
      a shadow as well. When hovering over a product description, users can observe the text change in color. Ideally,
      upon
      clilcking either the product image or the product description, it should go to a
      more detailed product information page. When hovering over a title bar, users can observe the title change in
      color. These interactive actions solve the problem of the ambiguity of the original website in showing the
      difference between clickable and non-clickable elements. By creating a clear contrast for the clickable elements
      through the interactive components, this new webpage shows clickable elements much better.

      I have also used combo boxes and an input box to better organize the information and facilitate users'
      navigation throughout the website.

      <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
      Link: <a href="https://mysterious-mesa-81226.herokuapp.com/">Redesigned Website</a><br><br>
      The website is fully responsive and interactive. It works as expected on all of the different device sizes,
      including for mobile, tablet, and desktop. I tried WebAIM WAVE on different screen sizes to make sure that my ]
      website is still accessible on different devices. I also used Developer Tools and Firefox Responsive Design Mode
      to see how the website looks on other devices and tried changing the font size. I also tested on other computer
      screens. It functions correctly!
